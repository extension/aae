    <h3>Your Ask an Expert Away Status Was Changed</h3>
    
    <p>This is a friendly notification that an Expert changed your "Away Status" using your <%= link_to 'Helping Hand', expert_edit_attributes_path(@user) %> page.</p>
    
    <p>This was probably done because we detected a vacation reply when a question was assigned to you.</p>

    <p>You can find a list of changes to your Profile in your <%= link_to "Profile History", history_expert_user_url(@user.id) %>.</p>
