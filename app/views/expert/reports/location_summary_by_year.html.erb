      <h3>Report Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each yearly report may take 20-30 seconds to load as it calculates the data for each location and caches the results. Current year data is cached for 1 day. 
          Prior year data will be cached for up to 1 week</li>
        <li><strong>Question location data should not be considered as an absolute value.</strong> Ask an Expert uses a commercial location detection service that matches internet protocol (IP) address. This service is ~90% accurate <strong>at best</strong> to the state level, and ~80% accurate <strong>at best</strong> within 40km (county level). Cell-network (mobile) submitters, submitters travelling and using public wifi networks, and often public wifi networks on University campuses may not report the location accurately. For widget-based questions, the widget configuration may not enable the collection of the question location. Detected location also can change over time. Significant changes and improvements in question location assignment were made in December 2012 which should be considered when doing year-over-year comparisons beginning in 2013 as compared to 2012 and earlier years.</li>
        <li>Expert location data uses the primary location as defined in the <a href="https://people.extension.org">eXtension People directory</a>. Not all experts have defined a primary location.</li>
        <li>Because questions can have multiple responses and multiple experts involved, any given question could be counted in both the "in-state answered" and "out-state answered" pool. Totals for "in-state answered" plus "out-state answered" may not match the total "questions answered" value for this reason.</li>
